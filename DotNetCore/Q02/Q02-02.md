## Q2-2: What is the difference between structs and classes?

- **Memory Allocation**: Structs are allocated on the stack, whereas classes are allocated on the heap.

- **Inheritance**: Structs do not support inheritance, while classes do.

- **Reference vs. Value**: Assigning a struct to a new variable copies the value, while assigning a class copies the reference.

Structs are best suited for small, simple data structures that don't require complex behavior or object-oriented features.
