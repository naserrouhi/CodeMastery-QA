## Q2: What is the difference between `string` and `String`?

`string` is an alias for `System.String`. So technically, there is no difference. It's like `int` vs. `System.Int32`.

It's generally recommended to use `string` any time you're referring to an object, And use `String` if you need to refer specifically to the class.

```csharp
string greet = String.Format("Hello {0}!", place);
```

???
Where class stores?
Copy of classes?
Reference type vs valueType?
Difference between class and struct?
Is struct constructor mandatory?
stack vs heap?
