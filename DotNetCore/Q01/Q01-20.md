## Q1-20: Name some alternatives to Bearer tokens.

1. **Basic Authentication**:
   - **Description**: Sends the user’s credentials (username and password) encoded in base64 in the HTTP Authorization header. It is a very simple but less secure form of authentication because the credentials can be easily decoded if not transmitted over HTTPS.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=
     ```

2. **API Key Authentication**:
   - **Description**: Involves sending a unique API key as part of the request, either in a header, as a query parameter, or in the body of the request. API keys are usually associated with a user or an application and are commonly used in web services.
   - **Example** (using a query parameter):
     ```http
     GET https://api.example.com/resource?api_key=your_api_key
     ```

3. **OAuth 1.0a**:
   - **Description**: A more complex authentication method where the token is signed with both a consumer secret and a token secret. OAuth 1.0a requires signatures to verify the authenticity of requests, making it more secure than bearer tokens but also more complex to implement.
   - **Example**: Instead of just using a token, OAuth 1.0a involves signatures that prevent tampering with the request.
     ```http
     Authorization: OAuth oauth_consumer_key="key", oauth_token="token", oauth_signature="signature", oauth_version="1.0"
     ```

4. **OAuth 2.0 with Proof-of-Possession (PoP)**:
   - **Description**: Instead of using bearer tokens, PoP tokens bind the token to a specific client or session using a cryptographic key, ensuring that the token can only be used by the intended holder. This makes it more secure than a bearer token, as the token alone is not enough; the client also needs to demonstrate knowledge of a secret key.
   - **Example**: The PoP token is cryptographically tied to the client’s session, but the exact format depends on the implementation.

6. **Session Cookies**:
   - **Description**: Instead of passing tokens in the Authorization header, session cookies store a token or session identifier on the client side. These cookies are automatically included in each request made to the server, maintaining the session.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     Cookie: sessionId=abc123xyz
     ```

7. **SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)**:
   - **Description**: An XML-based authentication protocol commonly used in Single Sign-On (SSO) systems. It allows secure exchange of authentication and authorization data between an identity provider and a service provider.
   - **Example**: The authentication is usually done by exchanging XML-based assertions, often handled by identity providers like Okta or Google.
