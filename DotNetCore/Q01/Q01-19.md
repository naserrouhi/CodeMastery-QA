## Q1-19: Explain types of tokens.

1. **Authentication Token**:
   - **Description**: Represents a user's identity and is used to verify that the user is authenticated. Once the user logs in, an authentication token is issued and can be used to access protected resources without needing to repeatedly send credentials.
   - **Example**: JWT

2. **Access Token**:
   - **Description**: Represents the authorization to access specific resources. Access tokens are issued after successful authentication.
   - **Example**: In OAuth 2.0, an access token is issued after the user grants permission to access certain resources.

3. **Refresh Token**:
   - **Description**: A long-lived token that is used to request a new access token once the previous one expires.
   - **Example**: In OAuth 2.0, a refresh token is issued alongside an access token.

4. **Bearer Token**:
   - **Description**: A type of token where the possession of the token grants access to a resource. The bearer token is typically included in the HTTP Authorization header.
   - **Example**: Most APIs that require access tokens expect them to be passed in the form of a bearer token.

5. **CSRF Token (Cross-Site Request Forgery Token)**:
   - **Description**: Used to protect against CSRF attacks, where an attacker tries to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a user. CSRF tokens are unique to each session and must be included in forms or requests to validate that the request is legitimate.
   - **Example**: Many web applications include a hidden CSRF token in forms that the server checks to verify the request.

6. **Session Token**:
   - **Description**: Used to maintain the session state between a client and a server. After a user logs in, a session token is generated and stored on the client (typically in cookies) to identify and authenticate the user for the duration of the session.
   - **Example**: In traditional web apps, when a user logs in, the server generates a session token, stores it in a cookie, and associates it with the user's session.
