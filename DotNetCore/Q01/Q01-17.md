## Q1-17: What is JWT?

**JWT** stands for **JSON Web Token**. It is an open standard (RFC 7519) used for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization purposes in web applications.

### Key Components of JWT:

A JWT consists of three parts, typically separated by dots (`.`):
1. **Header**
2. **Payload**
3. **Signature**

#### 1. **Header**:
   - **Content**: The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token (which is JWT) and the signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     {
       "alg": "HS256",
       "typ": "JWT"
     }
     ```

#### 2. **Payload**:
   - **Content**: The payload contains the claims, which are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. There are three types of claims:
     - **Registered claims**: Predefined claims like `iss` (issuer), `exp` (expiration time), and `sub` (subject).
     - **Public claims**: Claims that are defined in the JWT standard but can be used by anyone. They should be used with caution to avoid conflicts.
     - **Private claims**: Custom claims created by the developers that are specific to their application.
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     {
       "sub": "1234567890",
       "name": "John Doe",
       "admin": true
     }
     ```

#### 3. **Signature**:
   - **Content**: To create the signature, the encoded header, encoded payload, a secret key, and the algorithm specified in the header are combined. The signature ensures that the token hasn't been altered.
   - **Example**:
     - If using HMAC SHA256:
     ```text
     HMACSHA256(
       base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
       base64UrlEncode(payload),
       secret)
     ```

### Benefits of JWT:
- **Stateless**: JWTs are self-contained; all the information needed for verification is within the token, eliminating the need for session state on the server.
- **Scalable**: Since JWTs are stateless, they are ideal for distributed systems where the authentication server might be separate from other parts of the application.
- **Compact and Efficient**: JWTs are compact and can be easily transmitted via URLs, headers, or within POST parameters.
- **Secure**: JWTs can be signed and optionally encrypted to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.
