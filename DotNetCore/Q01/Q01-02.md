## Q1-2: What is RyuJIT?

RyuJIT is the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler used in the .NET framework, starting from .NET Framework 4.6 and .NET Core. It replaces the older JIT compiler, known as the "MSIL JIT," and is designed to improve performance and efficiency in the compilation of Intermediate Language (IL) code to native machine code.
