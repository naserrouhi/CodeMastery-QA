## What are cloud services?

They are computing resources provided over the internet. There are 3 main types:

1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Provides virtual machines, storage, and networking (e.g., AWS EC2, Microsoft Azure).

2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Offers a platform for developers to build and deploy applications without managing the underlying infrastructure (e.g., Google App Engine, Azure App Service).

3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Delivers software applications over the internet (e.g., Google Workspace, Microsoft 365).
