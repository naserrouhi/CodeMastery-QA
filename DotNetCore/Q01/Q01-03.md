## Q1-3: What is framework?

A framework is a pre-built collection of libraries, tools, and conventions that provides a structured environment for building applications. It offers reusable code and predefined architecture that developers can use to solve common programming problems, allowing them to focus on the unique aspects of their application rather than reinventing the wheel.

**Example**: Imagine you're building a house. A framework is like having pre-cut pieces of wood, blueprints, and tools that show you exactly how to put the house together. It makes the building process faster and easier.
