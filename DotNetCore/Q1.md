## Q1-1: What is CLR?

The Common Language Runtime (CLR) is the virtual machine component of Microsoft's .NET framework. It provides a managed execution environment for .NET applications, handling tasks such as memory management, security, and exception handling. Here are some key functions and features of the CLR:

1. **Memory Management**: The CLR includes a **garbage collector (GC)** that automatically handles memory allocation and deallocation, helping to prevent memory leaks and optimize resource usage.

2. **Type Safety**: The CLR enforces type safety, ensuring that code adheres to type rules and preventing type-related errors and vulnerabilities.

3. **Exception Handling**: It provides a structured approach to handling exceptions, allowing for robust error management and recovery within applications.

4. **Security**: The CLR includes a security model that enforces code access security (CAS) and provides mechanisms for defining and enforcing security policies.

5. **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation**: The CLR compiles **intermediate language (IL)** code into native machine code at runtime, optimizing performance and enabling cross-platform compatibility.

6. **Interoperability**: It provides mechanisms for interacting with unmanaged code and other programming environments, enabling integration with existing libraries and applications.

7. **Thread Management**: The CLR manages and schedules threads, providing support for multithreading and parallelism in .NET applications.

Overall, the CLR is a key component of the .NET ecosystem, providing a managed execution environment that simplifies development, enhances security, and improves performance.

## Q1-8: What is CAS?

CAS (Code Access Security) is a security model in the .NET Framework that controls what code can do based on where it comes from and other identity factors. It helps protect systems from untrusted or potentially harmful code by restricting its permissions.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Q1-9</summary>

## Q1-9: What security mechanisms or practices replace CAS in .NET Core??

In .NET Core and later versions (like .NET 5, .NET 6, and .NET 7), **Code Access Security (CAS)** is not supported. Instead of CAS, .NET Core uses other security practices and models to ensure application security. Here's what is used instead:

### 1. Operating System-Level Security:
   - **Permissions and Access Control**: In .NET Core, security is more tightly integrated with the underlying operating system. Permissions and access control are handled by the OS, so developers rely on the OS to enforce security boundaries, such as file system access, network access, and execution permissions.
   - **Principle of Least Privilege**: Applications are often run with the minimum necessary privileges. For example, services might run under specific user accounts with limited permissions, ensuring that even if a vulnerability is exploited, the damage is contained.

### 2. Sandboxing and Containers:
   - **Containers (e.g., Docker)**: Containers are a modern approach to isolating applications. By running .NET Core applications inside containers, you can create a sandboxed environment where the application is isolated from the host system. This limits the potential damage if the application is compromised.
   - **App Sandbox (macOS and iOS)**: On platforms like macOS and iOS, applications run in a sandbox, which restricts what they can do based on predefined policies.

### 3. AssemblyLoadContext:
   - **Custom Assembly Loading**: .NET Core introduces `AssemblyLoadContext`, which allows for more granular control over assembly loading. This can be used to create isolated environments within a .NET Core application, somewhat similar to the way Application Domains were used in .NET Framework, but without the full overhead of CAS.

### 4. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Claims-Based Security:
   - **Identity and Access Management**: In web applications, security models often rely on Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or Claims-Based Security. These models use user roles and claims (pieces of user information) to enforce security policies.
   - **ASP.NET Core Identity**: ASP.NET Core provides a robust identity system that supports authentication and authorization, allowing developers to define what actions different users or roles can perform.

### 5. Dependency Injection and Secure Coding Practices:
   - **Dependency Injection**: .NET Core heavily uses dependency injection, which helps manage dependencies and can be used to enforce security policies by controlling what components are available to the application.
   - **Secure Coding Practices**: Emphasis is placed on secure coding practices, such as input validation, output encoding, and avoiding common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).

### 6. Security Libraries and APIs:
   - **System.Security.Cryptography**: .NET Core includes the `System.Security.Cryptography` namespace, which provides a range of cryptographic functions for encryption, hashing, and secure data handling.
   - **JWT Tokens**: In web applications, JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are commonly used for secure, stateless authentication and authorization.

### Summary:
In .NET Core, instead of relying on CAS, security is achieved through a combination of operating system-level controls, containerization, role-based and claims-based security, dependency injection, secure coding practices, and modern security libraries. This approach is more aligned with contemporary security practices and allows .NET Core applications to be more flexible and secure in a variety of environments.

<summary>Q1-12</summary>

## Q1-12: What is CIL?

Common Intermediate Language (CIL) is a low-level, language-independent code used by the .NET Framework. It acts as an intermediate step between high-level programming languages and the native machine code executed by the hardware. CIL allows .NET applications to be portable and ensures interoperability between different .NET languages.

**Compilation Process:**

* **Source Code**: High-level source code written in a .NET language (e.g., C# or VB.NET) is first compiled into CIL by a language-specific compiler (e.g., the C# compiler csc).
* **Assembly**: The resulting CIL code is stored in an assembly, which is a compiled code library containing CIL and metadata.
* **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation**: When the application is run, the CLR’s JIT compiler converts the CIL code into native machine code specific to the hardware on which the application is running.

**Example:**

```cil
.assembly Program {}
.class public Program
{
    .method public static void Main()
    {
        .entrypoint
        // Code to write "Hello, World!" to the console
        ldstr "Hello, World!"
        call void [System.Console]System.Console::WriteLine(string)
        ret
    }
}
```

## Q1-15: What is API?

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of protocols and tools that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Q1-16</summary>

## Q1-16: How many API types do we have?

1. **Web APIs**:
   - **REST (Representational State Transfer)**: A popular architectural style for web APIs that uses standard HTTP methods and focuses on resources identified by URLs. Responses are often in JSON or XML format.

   - **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)**: A protocol for exchanging structured information using XML. It is more rigid than REST and includes a set of rules for request and response formats.

     **Example Request**:

     ```xml
     <soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:urn="urn:ebay:api:PayPalAPI">
       <soapenv:Header/>
       <soapenv:Body>
         <urn:GetBalanceReq>
           <urn:GetBalanceRequest>
             <urn:Version>94.0</urn:Version>
             <urn:Credential>
               <urn:Username>your-username</urn:Username>
               <urn:Password>your-password</urn:Password>
             </urn:Credential>
           </urn:GetBalanceRequest>
         </urn:GetBalanceReq>
       </soapenv:Body>
     </soapenv:Envelope>
     ```

     **Example Response**:

     ```xml
     <soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
       <soapenv:Body>
         <GetBalanceResponse xmlns="urn:ebay:api:PayPalAPI">
           <Balance>100.00</Balance>
           <CurrencyCode>USD</CurrencyCode>
         </GetBalanceResponse>
       </soapenv:Body>
     </soapenv:Envelope>
     ```

   - **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, and nothing more. It provides more flexibility compared to REST.
    
     **Example Request**:

     ```graphql
     query {
       repository(owner:"octocat", name:"Hello-World") {
         issues(last:20, states:CLOSED) {
           edges {
             node {
               title
               url
               labels(first:5) {
                 edges {
                   node {
                     name
                   }
                 }
               }
             }
           }
         }
       }
     }
     ```

     **Example Response**:

     ```json
     {
       "data": {
         "repository": {
           "issues": {
             "edges": [
               {
                 "node": {
                   "title": "Found a bug",
                   "url": "https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World/issues/1347",
                   "labels": {
                     "edges": [
                       {
                         "node": {
                           "name": "bug"
                         }
                       }
                     ]
                   }
                 }
               }
             ]
           }
         }
       }
     }
     ```

2. **Library or Framework APIs**:
   - **Function Calls**: APIs that provide functions or methods for interacting with a software library or framework. For example, the .NET Framework provides APIs for file I/O, database access, and more.

   ```csharp
   // Using .NET's File class to read a file
   string content = File.ReadAllText("example.txt");
   ```

3. **Operating System APIs**:
   - **System Calls**: APIs provided by operating systems to interact with hardware and system resources. For example, Windows API (WinAPI) provides functions for managing windows, files, and hardware.

4. **Database APIs**:
   - **Database Query Interfaces**: APIs that allow applications to interact with databases, such as SQL-based APIs for executing queries and retrieving results.

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserID = 1;
    ```

    ```javascript
    db.users.find({ "username": "johndoe" });
    ```

## Q1-17: What is JWT?

**JWT** stands for **JSON Web Token**. It is an open standard (RFC 7519) used for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization purposes in web applications.

### Key Components of JWT:

A JWT consists of three parts, typically separated by dots (`.`):
1. **Header**
2. **Payload**
3. **Signature**

#### 1. **Header**:
   - **Content**: The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token (which is JWT) and the signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     {
       "alg": "HS256",
       "typ": "JWT"
     }
     ```

#### 2. **Payload**:
   - **Content**: The payload contains the claims, which are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. There are three types of claims:
     - **Registered claims**: Predefined claims like `iss` (issuer), `exp` (expiration time), and `sub` (subject).
     - **Public claims**: Claims that are defined in the JWT standard but can be used by anyone. They should be used with caution to avoid conflicts.
     - **Private claims**: Custom claims created by the developers that are specific to their application.
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     {
       "sub": "1234567890",
       "name": "John Doe",
       "admin": true
     }
     ```

#### 3. **Signature**:
   - **Content**: To create the signature, the encoded header, encoded payload, a secret key, and the algorithm specified in the header are combined. The signature ensures that the token hasn't been altered.
   - **Example**:
     - If using HMAC SHA256:
     ```text
     HMACSHA256(
       base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
       base64UrlEncode(payload),
       secret)
     ```

### Benefits of JWT:
- **Stateless**: JWTs are self-contained; all the information needed for verification is within the token, eliminating the need for session state on the server.
- **Scalable**: Since JWTs are stateless, they are ideal for distributed systems where the authentication server might be separate from other parts of the application.
- **Compact and Efficient**: JWTs are compact and can be easily transmitted via URLs, headers, or within POST parameters.
- **Secure**: JWTs can be signed and optionally encrypted to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.
