Q1: What is .Net Core?

.NET Core is a free, open-source, and cross-platform framework developed by Microsoft. .NET Core is optimized for high performance, especially in web applications, and is designed to be cloud-ready with tight integration for building, deploying, and scaling cloud services.



Q1-1: What is CLR?

The Common Language Runtime (CLR) is the virtual machine component of Microsoft's .NET framework. It provides a managed execution environment for .NET applications, handling tasks such as memory management, security, and exception handling. Here are some key functions and features of the CLR:

1. **Memory Management**: The CLR includes a garbage collector that automatically handles memory allocation and deallocation, helping to prevent memory leaks and optimize resource usage.

2. **Type Safety**: The CLR enforces type safety, ensuring that code adheres to type rules and preventing type-related errors and vulnerabilities.

3. **Exception Handling**: It provides a structured approach to handling exceptions, allowing for robust error management and recovery within applications.

4. **Security**: The CLR includes a security model that enforces code access security (CAS) and provides mechanisms for defining and enforcing security policies.

5. **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation**: The CLR compiles intermediate language (IL) code into native machine code at runtime, optimizing performance and enabling cross-platform compatibility.

6. **Interoperability**: It provides mechanisms for interacting with unmanaged code and other programming environments, enabling integration with existing libraries and applications.

7. **Thread Management**: The CLR manages and schedules threads, providing support for multithreading and parallelism in .NET applications.

Overall, the CLR is a key component of the .NET ecosystem, providing a managed execution environment that simplifies development, enhances security, and improves performance.


Q1-2: What is RyuJIT?

RyuJIT is the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler used in the .NET framework, starting from .NET Framework 4.6 and .NET Core. It replaces the older JIT compiler, known as the "MSIL JIT," and is designed to improve performance and efficiency in the compilation of Intermediate Language (IL) code to native machine code.
