## Q1-5: What is platform?

A platform is the foundation that supports the development, deployment, and execution of software applications. It encompasses hardware, operating systems, and software frameworks, providing the necessary environment for applications to function.

**Example**: Think of your smartphone. The platform includes the phone itself (the hardware), the operating system (Android), and the app store. All apps you download and use are built to work on this platform.
