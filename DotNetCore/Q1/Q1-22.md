## Q1-22: What is Signing algorithm?

A **signing algorithm** is a cryptographic method used to create a digital signature for data, ensuring its integrity and authenticity. The signing process involves using a **private key** to generate the signature and a corresponding **public key** to verify it. 

In the context of **JWT (JSON Web Token)** or any secure system, the signing algorithm ensures that the token or data has not been tampered with and can only be verified by the intended parties.

### Key Points of a Signing Algorithm:
1. **Integrity**: Ensures that the data has not been modified after it was signed. If any changes are made, the signature verification will fail.
2. **Authenticity**: Verifies that the data was indeed signed by the rightful party (who holds the private key).
3. **Non-repudiation**: The signer cannot deny having signed the data since only they possess the private key.

### Common Signing Algorithms:
1. **HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)**:
   - **Algorithm**: `HS256`, `HS384`, `HS512` (HMAC with SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512)
   - **Description**: Symmetric algorithm where the same secret key is used for both signing and verifying the token. Faster but both the sender and receiver must share the same secret.
   - **Use case**: Commonly used in signing **JWT** tokens for web authentication.
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     {
       "alg": "HS256"
     }
     ```

2. **RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)**:
   - **Algorithm**: `RS256`, `RS384`, `RS512`
   - **Description**: Asymmetric algorithm that uses a pair of keys (a private key for signing and a public key for verifying). The public key is shared openly, while the private key is kept secret.
   - **Use case**: Secure systems where the verifier doesn't need to know the private key (e.g., public key infrastructure).
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     {
       "alg": "RS256"
     }
     ```

3. **ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)**:
   - **Algorithm**: `ES256`, `ES384`, `ES512`
   - **Description**: Asymmetric algorithm similar to RSA but uses elliptic curve cryptography, which provides the same level of security with smaller key sizes and more efficient computations.
   - **Use case**: Systems that need high performance and security, often used in mobile devices.
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     {
       "alg": "ES256"
     }
     ```

### How Signing Algorithms Work in JWT:

In a **JWT**, the signing algorithm is specified in the token header. When a JWT is created, the signing algorithm is used to sign the **header** and **payload** of the token, producing a **signature**. This signature ensures that the token has not been tampered with.

1. **Header**:
   ```json
   {
     "alg": "HS256", 
     "typ": "JWT"
   }
   ```

2. **Payload** (data):
   ```json
   {
     "sub": "1234567890",
     "name": "John Doe",
     "admin": true
   }
   ```

3. **Signature**: 
   - The signature is generated by signing the base64-encoded header and payload using the secret key (in the case of `HS256`) or private key (for `RS256` or `ES256`).
   - Example:
     ```http
     HMACSHA256(
       base64UrlEncode(header) + "." + base64UrlEncode(payload),
       secret
     )
     ```

4. **Verification**:
   - When a JWT is received, the server verifies the signature by using the same algorithm and key (secret or public) to recompute the signature. If the signature matches, the token is valid.

### Summary:
A **signing algorithm** is used to create a **digital signature** that ensures data integrity and authenticity. In the case of JWT, common signing algorithms include **HMAC**, **RSA**, and **ECDSA**, each with its own security model. The signature guarantees that the token or data has not been tampered with and allows secure authentication in systems like web applications.
