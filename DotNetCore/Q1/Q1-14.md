## Q1-14: What is FCL?

Framework Class Library (FCL) is a comprehensive collection of classes, interfaces, and value types provided by the .NET Framework such as file operations, data access, network communication, and graphical user interfaces.\
It offers a wide range of functionalities to simplify development tasks and promote code reuse. By using the FCL, developers can efficiently build applications without having to write common functionalities from scratch.\
The FCL provides a consistent and integrated development experience across different .NET languages and platforms.

FCL includes the BCL but also offers additional libraries and APIs for more specialized and advanced tasks, including web development, data access, GUI development, and more.
