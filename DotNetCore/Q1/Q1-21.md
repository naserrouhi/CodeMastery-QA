## Q1-21: What is session token?

A **session token** is a unique identifier issued by a server to a client upon a successful login or session creation. It is used to maintain session state between the client and the server. The session token is stored on the client side, typically in a cookie, and sent with each request to identify the session on the server. This allows the server to recognize the user across multiple requests without requiring them to log in again.

### How Session Tokens Work:
1. **User Authentication**:
   - The user provides credentials (like username and password) to log in.
   
2. **Session Token Creation**:
   - If the credentials are correct, the server generates a session token. The session token could be a random string, a signed token (like a JWT), or some other form of unique identifier.
   
3. **Session Token Storage**:
   - The server stores the session token (or a session identifier) in memory or a session store (like Redis or a database), associating it with session data (e.g., user ID, roles, preferences).
   - The session token is sent to the client, usually stored in a cookie.

4. **Client Sends Token in Requests**:
   - For each subsequent request, the client sends the session token back to the server, typically in the HTTP `Cookie` header.
   
5. **Server Validates the Token**:
   - The server retrieves the session data associated with the token and verifies that the session is valid (e.g., it hasn’t expired or been invalidated).

6. **Session Persistence**:
   - As long as the session is valid, the server processes the request and updates any session-related data as needed.

### Session Tokens in .NET Framework and ASP.NET:
In .NET, session tokens are typically managed by the **ASP.NET Session State** mechanism, which provides built-in support for maintaining user sessions.

#### How to Use Session Tokens in .NET:
1. **Session Creation**:
   - In ASP.NET, when a session is created (e.g., upon user login), a unique session ID is automatically generated and associated with the session data.
   - The session ID is stored on the server and the client receives a cookie (e.g., `ASP.NET_SessionId`).
   
   ```csharp
   Session["UserName"] = "JohnDoe";
   ```

2. **Session Token Stored in Cookie**:
   - The session ID is stored in a cookie that is automatically sent with each request to maintain the session.
   - Example cookie in HTTP request:
     ```http
     Cookie: ASP.NET_SessionId=abc123xyz
     ```

3. **Accessing Session Data**:
   - On each request, ASP.NET uses the session ID from the cookie to retrieve the session data stored on the server. This allows you to access session variables.
   
   ```csharp
   var userName = Session["UserName"];
   ```

4. **Session Storage Options**:
   - By default, ASP.NET stores session data **in-memory** on the server. However, this can be customized to store session tokens in a database, distributed cache (like Redis), or in a custom session store.
   
   **In-Memory (default)**:
   ```xml
   <sessionState mode="InProc" timeout="20" />
   ```
   
   **SQL Server** (session data stored in a SQL database):
   ```xml
   <sessionState mode="SQLServer" sqlConnectionString="data source=localhost;user id=sa;password=pass" />
   ```

   **Distributed (using Redis)**:
   ```csharp
   services.AddDistributedRedisCache(options => {
       options.Configuration = "localhost:6379";
   });

   services.AddSession();
   ```

5. **Session Expiration**:
   - The session token can expire based on inactivity or after a predefined timeout period. In ASP.NET, you can set the session timeout in the configuration:
   
   ```xml
   <sessionState timeout="30" />
   ```

6. **Session Authentication with Forms Authentication**:
   - In older versions of ASP.NET, **Forms Authentication** was often used in conjunction with session tokens. After a user logs in, a session token is generated and stored in a cookie to maintain the user’s authenticated session.
   - Example of setting an authentication cookie:
   
   ```csharp
   FormsAuthentication.SetAuthCookie(userName, isPersistent);
   ```

### Session Token vs JWT in .NET Core:
While traditional session tokens rely on server-side storage, **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** are stateless and do not require server-side storage. In .NET Core, **JWTs** are often used for **authentication** instead of session tokens, especially in **stateless** or **distributed systems**.

#### Example: Using JWT in .NET Core
1. **Generate JWT on Login**:
   - After successful login, you generate a JWT token with user claims:
   
   ```csharp
   var tokenHandler = new JwtSecurityTokenHandler();
   var key = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes("your-secret-key");
   var tokenDescriptor = new SecurityTokenDescriptor
   {
       Subject = new ClaimsIdentity(new[] {
           new Claim(ClaimTypes.Name, userName)
       }),
       Expires = DateTime.UtcNow.AddHours(1),
       SigningCredentials = new SigningCredentials(new SymmetricSecurityKey(key), SecurityAlgorithms.HmacSha256Signature)
   };
   var token = tokenHandler.CreateToken(tokenDescriptor);
   var tokenString = tokenHandler.WriteToken(token);
   ```

2. **Send JWT in Requests**:
   - The JWT is included in the Authorization header in subsequent requests:
     ```http
     Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
     ```

3. **Validate JWT on Each Request**:
   - The server validates the token and extracts claims to authenticate the user.

### Summary:
- A **session token** is used to maintain a user’s session on the server, typically stored in a cookie and used to identify requests across multiple interactions.
- In **ASP.NET** and **ASP.NET Core**, session tokens are handled via session state mechanisms, where the session ID is stored in a cookie.
- In modern **stateless** applications, **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** are often used instead of session tokens for authentication in **.NET Core** due to their simplicity and scalability in distributed environments.
