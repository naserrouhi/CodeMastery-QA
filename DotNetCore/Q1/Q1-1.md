## Q1-1: What is CLR?

The Common Language Runtime (CLR) is the virtual machine component of Microsoft's .NET framework. It provides a managed execution environment for .NET applications, handling tasks such as memory management, security, and exception handling. Here are some key functions and features of the CLR:

1. **Memory Management**: The CLR includes a **garbage collector (GC)** that automatically handles memory allocation and deallocation, helping to prevent memory leaks and optimize resource usage.

2. **Type Safety**: The CLR enforces type safety, ensuring that code adheres to type rules and preventing type-related errors and vulnerabilities.

3. **Exception Handling**: It provides a structured approach to handling exceptions, allowing for robust error management and recovery within applications.

4. **Security**: The CLR includes a security model that enforces code access security (CAS) and provides mechanisms for defining and enforcing security policies.

5. **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation**: The CLR compiles **intermediate language (IL)** code into native machine code at runtime, optimizing performance and enabling cross-platform compatibility.

6. **Interoperability**: It provides mechanisms for interacting with unmanaged code and other programming environments, enabling integration with existing libraries and applications.

7. **Thread Management**: The CLR manages and schedules threads, providing support for multithreading and parallelism in .NET applications.

Overall, the CLR is a key component of the .NET ecosystem, providing a managed execution environment that simplifies development, enhances security, and improves performance.
