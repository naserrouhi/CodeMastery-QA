## Q1-12: What is CIL?

Common Intermediate Language (CIL) is a low-level, language-independent code used by the .NET Framework. It acts as an intermediate step between high-level programming languages and the native machine code executed by the hardware. CIL allows .NET applications to be portable and ensures interoperability between different .NET languages.

**Compilation Process:**

* **Source Code**: High-level source code written in a .NET language (e.g., C# or VB.NET) is first compiled into CIL by a language-specific compiler (e.g., the C# compiler csc).
* **Assembly**: The resulting CIL code is stored in an assembly, which is a compiled code library containing CIL and metadata.
* **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation**: When the application is run, the CLRï¿½s JIT compiler converts the CIL code into native machine code specific to the hardware on which the application is running.

**Example:**

```cil
.assembly Program {}
.class public Program
{
    .method public static void Main()
    {
        .entrypoint
        // Code to write "Hello, World!" to the console
        ldstr "Hello, World!"
        call void [System.Console]System.Console::WriteLine(string)
        ret
    }
}
```
